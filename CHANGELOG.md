Okay, so I may or may not have destroyed all of the commit history on accident.
Well, maybe not all of it, but most of it is gone.
However, you can still view the 'orphaned' commits (orphaned since they're not attached to any branch) by clicking deployments.
If you know how to connect the 'orphaned' commits to the branch 'main', please, PLEASE create an issue for it.
Thank you.
